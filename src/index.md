# Welcome to the Steam Deck Nursery

I just received my own Steam Deck, and thought, that it would be awesome to document everything that I would love to know earlier. How install things, what to use, where is something, how should i do something, etc.

This book is mostly a collection of tips and tricks I am compiling together while tinkering with my Steam Deck.  

Why "Nursery"? Because it sounds cool, and is aimed at guiding beginners, or, new Steam Deck owners, how to do things I wanted to do but didn't know how.

Start by looking at [all things I wish I knew earlier](./wished_knowing.md).
