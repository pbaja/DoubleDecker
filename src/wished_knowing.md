A compilation of things I wished somebody would tell me earlier.

## Gaming mode
- STEAM + L1 (left bumper) opens up a magnifier
- STEAM + R1 (right bumper) takes a screenshot
- STEAM + B (long press) forcefully kills current game
- STEAM + X opens the virtual keyboard
- For all shortcuts, you can also use `...` button instead of the `STEAM` button

## Desktop Mode
- **THERE IS NO TEXT EDITOR**  
I am not counting vim, as using it without a physical keyboard makes no sense.  
I recommend installing a simple text editor: `KWrite`. You can find it in the Discover app.

- To enter the Desktop mode, click the Steam button, head all the way down to the Power menu, and click "Switch to Desktop"
- Use right touchpad to move your cursor and click. Use your left touchpad to right-click.
- If you exit steam, clicking the mouse is done by the left and right triggers.
- STEAM + X button combination opens virtual keyboard. You can use joystick or touchpads to use it.
