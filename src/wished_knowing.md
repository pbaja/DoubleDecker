# ðŸ§™ A compilation of things I wished somebody would tell me earlier
As the title says. Really, these things should be known as soon as possible.

## Gaming mode
- To take a screenshot, press STEAM + R1 (right bumper)

## Desktop Mode
**THERE IS NO TEXT EDITOR**  
I am not counting vim, as using it without a physical keyboard makes no sense.  
I recommend installing a simple text editor: `KWrite`. You can find it in the Discover app.

- To enter the Desktop mode, click the Steam button, head all the way down to the Power menu, and click "Switch to Desktop"
- Use right touchpad to move your cursor and click. Use your left touchpad to right-click.
- If you exit steam, clicking the mouse is done by the left and right triggers. ðŸ˜¶
- STEAM + X button combination opens virtual keyboard. You can use joystick or touchpads to use it.
- When STEAM or "three dot" buttons are pressed, they change some button functions of the gamepad.

## Advanced
- To see list of available desktop icons use Cuttlefish app.
