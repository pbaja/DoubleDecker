# ðŸ’¾ Choosing an SD card

> ðŸš§ This page is a work in progress

## General rules
- Do not get scammed. Genuine 512GB cards are expensive. Genuine 1TB cards are ridiculously expensive.
- Steam Deck card reader has maximum bandwith of 100MB/s. Getting faster cards is pointless.
- Write speeds doesn't really matter - unless you have a very fast internet, or playing minecraft.
- Cards with write/read speed greater than 100MB/s has a point if a given card also has better random write/read speed.

TL;DR
Do not buy cheap cards. Also, do not buy expensive cards.

## Reputable brands
1. Lexar, Kioxia
2. Samsung, SanDisk
3. PNY, Kingston, Transcend, GoodRam, Patriot

A few examples of what you can expect:

| Name                           | Read  | Write | Rand Read | Rand Write |
|--------------------------------|-------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Lexar Professional 1800x 128GB | 290.1 | 211.0 | 15.5      | 1.5        |
| SanDisk Extreme Pro 64GB       | 290.7 | 111.5 | 14.6      | 1.3        |
| Samsung Pro Plus 128GB         | 96.6  | 84.9  | 9.0       | 2.2        |
| SanDisk Ultra 128GB            | 99.2  | 78.3  | 6.5       | 3.5        |
| Lexar Professional 633x 128GB  | 88.2  | 23.2  | 5.2       | 0.9        |
| Samsung Evo Plus 256GB         | 88.2  | 23.0  | 5.1       | 0.9        |

*All speeds are in MB/s. Rand Read/Write = 4K Random Read/Write*  


## Summary
Take results in above table with a grain of salt. Underlying SD cards technology change often. There are many versions, batches and revisions. Even cards with the same name can perform differently if are made for the EU or US market. Above table is there only for a comparison between card capacities, brands and their performance.

- Usually more capacity gets you worse random read/write performance
- Paying 30% more for better speeds, that will give you 0.5s faster load speeds is completely pointless
- Buy SD cards from reputable brands and reputable sellers.
- Yes, scammers can print "SanDisk 1TB" on their 64GB cards.
